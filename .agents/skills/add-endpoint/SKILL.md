# Add an endpoint

1. Read the existing controller and tests to match conventions.
2. Write a MockMvc test for the new endpoint first, including error cases.
3. Implement the endpoint. Keep business logic out of the controller.
4. Run .\mvnw.cmd test and fix failures until all pass.
5. Summarize the change and list the files you touched.
6. make sure the implementation matches the current logic and structure.
